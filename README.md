# DeliveryRobot
##Introduction##
Virginia Tech has more than 38,000 students on and off campus. With all those students trying to find a
quick place to eat in between classes, one could imagine how hard that could be. This would be
impossible due to long dining hall lines, cluttered seating area, and could even be all the way across
campus. Not all students are able to access dining throughout the day, especially if they happen to be
injured, disabled, or even sick. The last thing students want is for other sick students to contaminate the
dining halls. James Madison University has been using starship robots to deliver food. According to the
company starship itself, college students across the US claim that by using robots to deliver their food,
they can study more, not miss meals, improve their mental health, as well as feel safer on campus at
times with lower visibility. The only con is that these robots can cost from $2500-5000 which is not a
cheap expense for a college with over 38,000 students. After seeing how well robot food delivery has
worked for other colleges, that gave our team the idea to make a robot for food delivery.
##Stakeholders##
Students that are unable to or have difficulty traveling to dining halls would be most impacted by an
implementation of delivery robots. The main demographic of students that we are concerned about is
people with disabilities. Starship, a company that produces delivery robots, reports that “as many as
25% of people using Starship robots have a disability or live with someone who does,” from a customer
survey they took [19]. Seeing how a large percentage of people that use delivery robots are disabled, it
would make sense to use them in a greater area of highly concentrated people, such as Virginia Tech
campus, to make a more inclusive environment. Another stakeholder to keep in mind is who would be
paying to implement delivery robots, which would be the University itself. George Mason has 60 robots
for an on-campus population of about 6300 students [20, 21]. This would mean that Virginia Tech’s oncampus population of about 9300 students would need around 90 robots [22]. Using the price range,
the cumulative cost would come out to be 225,000-450,000 dollars for a fleet of delivery robots. With
Virginia Tech’s “$2.06 billion university budget for the 2023-2024 fiscal year,” $450,000 would be
considered a relatively low investment [8].
##Past Alternative solutions##
Virginia Tech has tried implementing a couple of solutions like Grubhub, building more dining halls and
trying to hire more people to help with this problem. However, these solutions have either not worked or
have not been able to completely get rid of the problem. Out of these solutions Grubhub seems to be the
solution that works best. By having students order online this limits the amount of people lining up inside
the dining halls as students do not have to wait in line to order their food. Although this seems like a viable
solution at first, students still need to go inside the dining halls to collect their meals. The problem
becomes worse when Grubhub orders become delayed and then you have the lines plus the people
waiting for their Grubhub order waiting in the same area. Virginia Tech also tried to solve this problem by
hiring more people in the dining halls. They have started to incentivize working at dining halls by
advertising throughout campus and offering a starting rate of $16 an hour [4]. The only problem is that
they have not been hiring enough as most days the dining halls are short-staffed which leads to delays in
Grubhub orders and longer lines overall. The final solution that Virginia Tech has tried is by building more
dining halls. 
This would help disperse the students across multiple buildings, reducing the total number of students in one single dining hall at a time. 
However, this has major drawbacks as building a whole new dining hall is time consuming and expensive. 
They would also have to find a whole new set of employees,
which they already struggle to do, for the new dining hall.
##Design Idea##
Our main design will consist of a robot made of 4 wheels on a small base that holds a container to store
food. Since we are mainly just making a prototype of an actual delivery robot, the robot will be made of
materials like metal bars and cardboard. The base holding the motors and the wheels would be made of
metal bars. The container would either be made of acrylic or cardboard. The base would hold the box
on top and hold the motors on the bottom, with all parts being connected by nuts and bolts. Our design
will be both physical and digital, the physical aspect being the robot itself and the digital aspect being
the basic control code that allows for user control. The robot itself will be in a square shape for better
turning with the base being around 1 foot x 1 foot.
