# DeliveryRobot
Virginia Tech has more than 38,000 students on and off campus. With all those students trying to find a
quick place to eat in between classes, one could imagine how hard that could be. This would be
impossible due to long dining hall lines, cluttered seating area, and could even be all the way across
campus. Not all students are able to access dining throughout the day, especially if they happen to be
injured, disabled, or even sick. The last thing students want is for other sick students to contaminate the
dining halls. James Madison University has been using starship robots to deliver food. According to the
company starship itself, college students across the US claim that by using robots to deliver their food,
they can study more, not miss meals, improve their mental health, as well as feel safer on campus at
times with lower visibility. The only con is that these robots can cost from $2500-5000 which is not a
cheap expense for a college with over 38,000 students. After seeing how well robot food delivery has
worked for other colleges, that gave our team the idea to make a robot for food delivery.
